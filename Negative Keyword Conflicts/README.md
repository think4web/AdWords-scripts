# Negative Keyword Conflicts - Single Account

I use this script with the settings recommended by Google in several accounts. When conflicts are found, the script sends me letters with the subject "Negative Keyword Conflicts Found", but without specifying an account. Itâ€™s hard for me to understand if I fixed the conflicts. I modified the script and now the Google Ads account name will be automatically substituted in the subject of the letter.
